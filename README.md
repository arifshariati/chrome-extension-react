## ReactJs for Building Chrome Extension

Since reactjs produces single page javascript file, it is great for creating fully fleged production level chrome extensions. 

### Don't forget 
In order for chrome to accept your extension, do not forget below before uploading extension.

```
    1. remove icons key from manifest.js 
    2. add required key in manifest.js for chrome
    3. build your react project (npm run build)
    4. enable chrome extnsion in developer mode
    5. select your build folder for uploading extension via load unpacked button 

```

Cheers!
